We are happy to announce the official creation of the **Cloud Native Provence** association.

Our goal is simple: bring the local community together, organize high-quality meetups, and promote open-source culture around Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this launch. More is coming very soon.
